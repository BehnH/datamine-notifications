# datamine-notifications

ðŸš§ **This Project is a heavy WIP and should not be run in production** ðŸš§

A Notification bot built for notifying you of changes to the [Discord Datamine repository](https://github.com/Discord-datamining/discord-datamining)

If you would like a completely hands-off experience with this project, add the official bot [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=936623386556244038&permissions=275415092224&scope=applications.commands%20bot) - Self-hosting can also be accomplished with ease, check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/BehnH/datamine-notifications/wiki) for more information.
## Project Goals
This project's primary goal is to provide a simple way for developers, and other interested parties, to view information about recent Discord builds that have not yet been formally announced by the platform.

We do this in 2 ways - Firstly, provide an option to manually gather information about the latest relevant build, and secondly by allowing build notes to be posted within 5 minutes of landing on GitHUb.
The bot's aim is to be lightweight & simple to use, making use of Slash Commands **only**.
